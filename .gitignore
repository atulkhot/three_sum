# Depending on your IDE or editor, you might want to ignore these:
# VS Code
.vscode/

# IntelliJ IDEA / CLion
.idea/

# Emacs
*.elc
# Backup files
*~
# Auto-save files
#*#

# Vim
*.swp
*.swo
*.bak
*.orig
*.rej

# Operating system specific files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Other common files to ignore
# Logs
*.log
*.txt
*.lock

# Dependency lock files that might be generated by tools other than Cargo
# For example, if you use a tool like 'cargo-audit' or 'cargo-deny'
# Cargo.lock is typically tracked, but if you have other lock files, ignore them.
# For example, if using some specific build system that creates another lock file:
# SomeOtherLock.lock
